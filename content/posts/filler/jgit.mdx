Since My master's thesis is on exploring better support for software history exploration, I had a chance to work with [JGit](https://www.eclipse.org/jgit/) quite a bit as I used JGit to extract the revision history from my Git repositories. JGit is a Java library for implementing the Git version control system. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find as many examples out there for doing specific operations with JGit so I wanted to share them here!

Feel free to explore the [test bed repository](https://github.com/Alison-Li/better-git-history) I developed and used for investigating a file's commit history. The outcomes from this has ended up serving as the basis for an approach I'm currently developing as part of an [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) plugin for making software history exploration more effective and efficient.

Assuming you have an initialized `Git` object like this:

```java
private final Git git = new Git(MY_REPOSITORY);
```

Below is how to get the entire Git history for a file, including renames of the file or old paths of the file.
Credit goes to this [StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11471836/how-to-git-log-follow-path-in-jgit-to-retrieve-the-full-history-includi) as it is a slight modification of it.

```java
/**
     * Retrieve the full Git history for a given file, including file renames/old paths.
     * @param filePath The file to get the full history for.
     * @return A map with the commit mapped to the file path in that commit.
     *          The entries in the map are ordered from most recent commit to oldest commit.
     */
    public Map<RevCommit, String> getFileCommitHistory(String filePath) {
        Map<RevCommit, String> commitMap = new LinkedHashMap<>();
        String updatedPath = filePath;
        try {
            RevCommit startCommit = null;
            do {
                Iterable<RevCommit> log = git.log()
                        .addPath(updatedPath)
                        .setRevFilter(RevFilter.NO_MERGES)
                        .call();
                for (RevCommit commit : log) {
                    if (commitMap.containsKey(commit)) {
                        startCommit = null;
                    } else {
                        startCommit = commit;
                        commitMap.put(commit, updatedPath);
                    }
                }
                if (startCommit == null) return commitMap;
            }
            while ((updatedPath = getRenamedPath(startCommit, filePath)) != null);
        } catch (GitAPIException | IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Error while collecting fileNames.");
        }
        return commitMap;
    }

        private String getRenamedPath(RevCommit startCommit, String initialPath) throws IOException, GitAPIException {
        Iterable<RevCommit> allCommitsLater = git.log()
                .add(startCommit)
                .setRevFilter(RevFilter.NO_MERGES)
                .call();
        for (RevCommit commit : allCommitsLater) {
            TreeWalk treeWalk = new TreeWalk(repository);
            treeWalk.addTree(commit.getTree());
            treeWalk.addTree(startCommit.getTree());
            treeWalk.setRecursive(true);
            RenameDetector renameDetector = new RenameDetector(repository);
            renameDetector.addAll(DiffEntry.scan(treeWalk));
            List<DiffEntry> files = renameDetector.compute();
            for (DiffEntry diffEntry : files) {
                if ((diffEntry.getChangeType() == DiffEntry.ChangeType.RENAME ||
                        diffEntry.getChangeType() == DiffEntry.ChangeType.COPY) &&
                        diffEntry.getNewPath().contains(initialPath)) {
                    return diffEntry.getOldPath();
                }
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```

Generate the content of a given file for each commit in the file's commit history:

```java
/**
     * Takes a file's commit history and generates what the file looked like for each commit.
     * The resulting files are in the "out" directory with the name being "ver#.java" where # is the version of the
     * file and 0 represents the oldest version of the file.
     * @param commitMap A file's commit history.
     * @return A map of commits mapped to the file path for their generated file versions.
     * @throws IOException From calling a class method for writing files.
     */
    public Map<RevCommit, String> generateFilesFromFileCommitHistory(Map<RevCommit, String> commitMap)
            throws IOException {
        if (!FileUtil.isTempDirectoryEmpty()) {
            FileUtil.cleanTempDirectory();
        }

        // Generate a dummy file as the first commit adds a file/content to a file.
        File dummyFile = new File("temp/ver0");
        dummyFile.createNewFile();

        Map<RevCommit, String> commitToFileVerMap = new LinkedHashMap<>();
        // Recall that the commit map is ordered from most recent commit to oldest.
        int count = commitMap.size();
        for (Map.Entry<RevCommit, String> entry : commitMap.entrySet()) {
            RevCommit commit = entry.getKey();
            String filePath = entry.getValue();
            String newFilePath = String.format("temp/ver%d", count);
            this.getFileFromCommit(commit, filePath, newFilePath);
            commitToFileVerMap.put(commit, newFilePath);
            count--;
        }
        return commitToFileVerMap;
    }
```

Get the filepath name of a file in a commit:

```java
   /**
     * Get the given filepath in the commit.
     * @param commit The commit to retrieve the file from.
     * @param filePath The file to retrieve.
     * @param newFilePath The file path of the newly created file that will store the contents of the retrieved file.
     */
    public void getFileFromCommit(RevCommit commit, String filePath, String newFilePath) throws IOException {
        File file = new File(newFilePath);
        if (file.createNewFile()) {
            try (TreeWalk treeWalk = TreeWalk.forPath(repository, filePath, commit.getTree())) {
                ObjectId objectId = treeWalk.getObjectId(0);
                ObjectLoader loader = repository.open(objectId);
                loader.copyTo(new FileOutputStream(file, false));
            } catch (IOException e) {
                System.out.println("Error while looking for file in commit");
            }
        } else {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("New file path already exists. Please try another file path to store the result in.");
        }
    }
